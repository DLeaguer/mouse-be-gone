1. ```copy``` the clone link

#### ~ FROM THIS POINT ON YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE YOUR MOUSE ~
### Don't forget to commit your work often!

1. Open your terminal
1. Change directory to the project folder
1. Clone the repository
1. Open the project in your text editor
1. Complete each of the tasks below BEFORE the Final Quest!

### Good luck!

## Tasks

### Level One (Let's Get It Started!)

#### Set Up
